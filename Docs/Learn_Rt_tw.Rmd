在特定的時刻($t$)，一個有傳染力的新病人可以傳給多少人  

### Why is this important?

- R0 can help people having a quick understanding of the disease and taking actions as fast as possible.

### What we need to estimate R0
**1. Contact and transmission: easier to transmit, larger R0**

- How people usually contact
  - How people greeting
  - How people travelling
- How the pathogen transmit
  - By air: wider spreading, sustaining shorter
  - By aerosol: intermediate spreading, sustain longer  
  - By close contacts: narrower spreading, pathogen survive according to surfaces
  
**2. Disease duration: longer disease duration, larger R0**

- How long the treatment does need
- How deadly the disease is

### FAQ
**Is there one R0 for one disease?**

- No. even for one disease, R0 varies by weather, crowdedness, setting specific behaviour, health systems, etc.
