## Basic reproduction number (R0, \[R_0\])
Where no one else is immune to the infection, how many infection can be generated by an infecious case?   

### What we need to estimate R0
**1. Cantact and transmission: easier to transmit, larger R0**
- How people usually contact
  - How people greeting
  - How poeple travelling
- How the pathogen transmit
  - By air: wider spreading, sustaining shorter
  - By aerosol: intermediate spreading, sustain longer  
  - By contact: narrower spreading, pathogen survive according to surfaces
**2. Disease duration: loger disease duration, larger R0**
- How long the treatment does need
- How deadly the disease is

**Why is this important?**
- R0 can help people having a queck understanding of a disease, and taking actions as fast as possible.
**Is there one R0 for one disease?**
- No. even for one disease, R0 varies by weather, crowdedness, setting specific behaviour, health systems, etc.
