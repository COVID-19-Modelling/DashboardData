#### **Doubling time** evaluates when the epi size will get doubled. 


### Why is this important?
- We can have a quick deadline for preparing and deploying resources.
- Decreasing doubling time: the outbreaking is happening
- Increasing doubling time: the epidemic is getting controlled



### What is needed for calculating doubling time
- The time-series of cumulative cases


### To be noted that, doubling time
- does not consider the transmission components.
- is only useful in the beginning of an epidemic
- will be less useful when the herd immunity becomes significant (that is, the epidemic starts decelerating).
- will go infinity when the epidemic is well-controlled
