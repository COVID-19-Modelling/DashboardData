### SIR model
A Suscepitable-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model consider an population is made of three types of people

- $I$: number of infectious people
- $S$: number of people who can be infected
- $N$: population size of whom can be reached by the pathogen


The model is usually formulated as 

$$ \frac{dS}{dt}=- \beta \frac{I}{N}S $$
$$ \frac{dI}{dt}=\beta \frac{I}{N}S - (\gamma + \mu) I $$



#### Parameters

- $\beta$: transmission rate, per contact-day
- $\gamma$: recovery rate, per day 
- $\mu$: death rate, per day
- $N$: population size of whom can be reached by the pathogen
