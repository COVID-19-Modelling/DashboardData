### SEIR model
A Suscepitable-Exopsed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model consider an population is made of four types of people


- $S$: number of people who can be infected
- $E$: number of people who have been infected but not developed infectivity yet
- $I$: number of infectious people

The model is usually formulated as 

$$ \frac{dS}{dt}=- \beta \frac{I}{N}S $$

$$\frac{dE}{dt}=\beta \frac{I}{N}S - \tau E$$
$$ \frac{dI}{dt}=\tau E - (\gamma + \mu) I $$

#### Parameters

- $\tau$: the invasion of latent period
- $\beta$: transmission rate, per contact-day
- $\gamma$: recovery rate, per day 
- $\mu$: death rate, per day
- $N$: population size of whom can be reached by the pathogen
