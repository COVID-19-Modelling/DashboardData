### Cap-SIR model
A Suscepitable-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model with the healthcare capacity consider an population is made of four types of people


- $S$: number of people who can be infected
- $I$: number of infectious people who are seeking care
- $H$: number of infectious people who have been identified (and isolated)


The model is usually formulated as 

$$ \frac{dS}{dt}=- \beta \frac{I}{N}S $$

$$\frac{dI}{dt}=\beta \frac{I}{N}S - (1 - \frac{I}{C}) I - (\gamma + \mu) I$$
$$ \frac{dH}{dt}=(1 - \frac{I}{C}) I - (\gamma + \mu) H $$

, where $(1 - \frac{I}{C})$ will move toward 0 as $I$ reaching the capacity $C$.

Only deaths and the recovered after $H$ will be documented.

#### Parameters

- $\tau$: the invasion of latent period
- $\beta$: transmission rate, per contact-day
- $\gamma$: recovery rate, per day 
- $\mu$: death rate, per day
- $C$: Healthcare capacity 
- $N$: population size of whom can be reached by the pathogen
